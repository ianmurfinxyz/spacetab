## Spacetab

A simple python script for replacing space indents in a source file for tab indents.

Why? Because spaces are consistent across all environments. Which is not a good thing!

Indent consistency reduces code accessibility.

Different people like different indents.

Be kind and keep tabbing.

### Usage

```
Usage: spacetab [OPTION] ... FILE [FILE ...]

Converts space indents to tab indents in FILE.

	I once was blind but now I see.
	Tabs are all that must be!
	To the world of space sinners I donate to thee.
	A script of forgiveness, by a tab devotee.

OPTIONS:
	-c	Number of space to compress into a single tab.
	-h	Show this help message.
